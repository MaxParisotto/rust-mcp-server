# Worklog

## 2025-03-10
- Completed logging standardization in test-client.mjs
  - Replaced all console.log/error calls with logger utility
  - Added consistent timestamp and log level formatting
  - Standardized error message formatting with JSON.stringify
- Fixed MCP server startup issues:
  - Identified the problem: Node.js was trying to run TypeScript files directly without compilation
  - Verified that TypeScript files had been compiled to JavaScript in the dist directory
  - Started the server using the correct command: `npm run start` which runs the compiled JavaScript files
  - Server now running successfully on port 3000
